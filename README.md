# React Dashboard Project

In this project I was using react to build a dashboard for employees.
The project is in progress and is a big learning curve for me.
Many of the features are still MVP.

## The Plan

The plan for this project was to connect it to Symfony (PHP Framework) but sadly the bootcamp didn't go as planned and my project was left half finished but I am determined to continue the project and finish it, after this project I worked on Symfony and soon I will figure out how to connect it as a Rest API.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run server`

Runs the JSON server on port 8000
